## Abstract
This project presents a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard developed using the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset** to uncover the key drivers of employee attrition, performance, and compensation. The dashboard leverages Power BI to transform raw HR data into actionable insights that support strategic workforce planning and evidence-based decision-making.

Through interactive visualizations, the analysis explores how demographic factors, job characteristics, overtime, commute distance, marital status, education level, and tenure influence employee turnover and performance outcomes. The findings highlight high-risk employee segments, compensation disparities, and performance trends, enabling organizations to design targeted retention strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and strengthen overall workforce stability.

## Project Overview
This HR Analytics Dashboard provides a data-driven examination of workforce dynamics using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset. The dataset contains rich employee-level information, enabling deep exploration of attrition drivers, compensation patterns, performance trends, and demographic influences. The dashboard integrates multiple dimensions of employee information—including demographics, job roles, compensation, performance ratings, satisfaction metrics, overtime behavior, and commute distance—to reveal patterns that influence employee retention and organizational stability. The project demonstrates advanced Power BI capabilities, including data modeling, DAX calculations, interactive visual design, and insight driven storytelling—showcasing the ability to convert complex HR data into strategic business intelligence.

At its core, the project aims to bridge the gap between raw HR data and actionable business insights. Modern organizations face increasing pressure to retain top talent, optimize workforce performance, and maintain a healthy organizational culture. However, without a structured analytical framework, HR teams often struggle to identify the root causes of turnover, understand compensation disparities, or evaluate how demographic and behavioral factors influence employee outcomes. This dashboard addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, visually intuitive platform that highlights the most critical workforce trends. The dataset itself contains a rich blend of demographic attributes, job‑related characteristics, compensation metrics, performance ratings, and work‑life balance indicators. By integrating these variables into a cohesive analytical model, the dashboard enables users to explore how factors such as age, marital status, education level, overtime frequency, commute distance, job role, and tenure contribute to attrition risk and performance variability. The result is a multi‑dimensional view of the workforce that goes far beyond surface‑level reporting.
